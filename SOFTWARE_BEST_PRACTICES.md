## Classes

* Try to make your classes as
  [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design\))
  as possible.
* When designing class hierarchies make sure that they conform to the
  [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
* Use a consistent structure in your class definitions.
* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). 

## Methods

* Methods should not be longer than five lines of code.
  Empty lines do not contribute to the relevant LOC.
* Avoid parameter lists longer than four parameters.
