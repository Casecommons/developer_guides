# Ruby Style Guide

This guide is a modified version of https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide.

The guide is a work in progress and a couple of things to note 
as we try and move towards using these guidelines:
  * Be consistent
  * Don't rewrite legacy code, unless you are working in that area
  * If you don't like a rule or want to add a new rule, please bring it up during 
standup or via group email, get consensus from the team and then add it to this guide.

## Source Code Layout

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.
* Use two **spaces** per indentation level. No hard tabs.
* Keep lines fewer than **80** characters.
* Never leaving trailing whitespace.

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around `{`
  and before `}`.

    ```Ruby
    sum = 1 + 2
    a, b = 1, 2
    1 > 2 ? true : false; puts 'Hi'
    [1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }
    ```

    The only exception, regarding operators, is the exponent operator:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    e = M * c ** 2

    # good
    e = M * c**2
    ```
* No spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`.

    ```Ruby
    some(arg).other
    [1, 2, 3].length
    ```

* Prefer a single-line format for class definitions with no body.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class FooError < StandardError
    end

    # good
    class FooError < StandardError; end
    ```

* Avoid single-line methods. Although they are somewhat popular in the
  wild, there are a few peculiarities about their definition syntax
  that make their use undesirable. At any rate - there should no more
  than one expression in a single-line method.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def too_much; something; something_else; end

    # okish - notice that the first ; is required
    def no_braces_method; body end

    # okish - notice that the second ; is optional
    def no_braces_method; body; end

    # okish - valid syntax, but no ; make it kind of hard to read
    def some_method() body end

    # good
    def some_method
      body
    end
    ```

    One exception to the rule are empty-body methods.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    def no_op; end
    ```

* Indent `when` as deep as `case`. I know that many would disagree
  with this one, but it's the style established in both "The Ruby
  Programming Language" and "Programming Ruby".

    ```Ruby
    case
    when song.name == 'Misty'
      puts 'Not again!'
    when song.duration > 120
      puts 'Too long!'
    when Time.now.hour > 21
      puts "It's too late"
    else
      song.play
    end

    kind = case year
           when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
           when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
           when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
           when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
           when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
           else 'Jazz'
           end
    ```


* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method parameters:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(arg1=:default, arg2=nil, arg3=[])
      # do something...
    end

    # good
    def some_method(arg1 = :default, arg2 = nil, arg3 = [])
      # do something...
    end
    ```

    While several Ruby books suggest the first style, the second is much more prominent
    in practice (and arguably a bit more readable).

* When continuing a chained method invocation on another line keep the `.` on the second line.
And indent 2 spaces on the second line

    ```Ruby
    # bad - need to consult first line to understand second line
    one.two.three.
      four

    # good - it's immediately clear what's going on the second line
    one.two.three
      .four
    ```

* Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one line.

    ```Ruby
    # starting point (line is too long)
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com', from: 'us@example.com', subject: 'Important message', body: source.text)
    end

    # bad (normal indent)
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(
        to: 'bob@example.com',
        from: 'us@example.com',
        subject: 'Important message',
        body: source.text)
    end

    # bad (double indent)
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(
          to: 'bob@example.com',
          from: 'us@example.com',
          subject: 'Important message',
          body: source.text)
    end

    # good
    def send_mail(source)
      Mailer.deliver(to: 'bob@example.com',
                     from: 'us@example.com',
                     subject: 'Important message',
                     body: source.text)
    end
    ```

* Add underscores to large numeric literals to improve their readability.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - how many 0s are there?
    num = 1000000

    # good - much easier to parse for the human brain
    num = 1_000_000
    ```

## Syntax

* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the
  parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments.

     ```Ruby
     def some_method
       # body omitted
     end

     def some_method_with_arguments(arg1, arg2)
       # body omitted
     end
     ```

* Never use `for`, unless you know exactly why. Most of the time iterators
  should be used instead. `for` is implemented in terms of `each` (so
  you're adding a level of indirection), but with a twist - `for`
  doesn't introduce a new scope (unlike `each`) and variables defined
  in its block will be visible outside it.

    ```Ruby
    arr = [1, 2, 3]

    # bad
    for elem in arr do
      puts elem
    end

    # good
    arr.each { |elem| puts elem }
    ```

* Never use `then` for multi-line `if/unless`.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition then
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if some_condition
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This
  also means that ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer
  `if/else` constructs in these cases.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    some_condition ? (nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else) : something_else

    # good
    if some_condition
      nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else
    else
      something_else
    end
    ```

* Use `!` instead of `not`.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - braces are required because of op precedence
    x = (not something)

    # good
    x = !something
    ```

* The `and` and `or` keywords are banned. It's just not worth
  it. Always use `&&` and `||` instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    # boolean expression
    if some_condition and some_other_condition
      do_something
    end

    # control flow
    document.saved? or document.save!

    # good
    # boolean expression
    if some_condition && some_other_condition
      do_something
    end

    # control flow
    document.saved? || document.save!
    ```

* Favor modifier `if/unless` usage when you have a single-line
  body. Another good alternative is the usage of control flow `&&/||`.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition
      do_something
    end

    # good
    do_something if some_condition

    # another good option
    some_condition && do_something
    ```

* Never use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    unless success?
      puts 'failure'
    else
      puts 'success'
    end

    # good
    if success?
      puts 'success'
    else
      puts 'failure'
    end
    ```

* Don't use parentheses around the condition of an `if/unless/while`,
  unless the condition contains an assignment (see "Using the return
  value of `=`" below).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if (x > 10)
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if x > 10
      # body omitted
    end

    # ok
    if (x = self.next_value)
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Omit parentheses around parameters for methods that are part of an
  internal DSL (e.g. Rake, Rails, RSpec), methods that have
  "keyword" status in Ruby (e.g. `attr_reader`, `puts`) and attribute
  access methods. Use parentheses around the arguments of all other
  method invocations.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :name, :age

      # omitted
    end

    temperance = Person.new('Temperance', 30)
    temperance.name

    puts temperance.age

    x = Math.sin(y)
    array.delete(e)

    bowling.score.should == 0
    ```

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks.  Avoid using
  `{...}` for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always
  ugly). Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs).  Avoid `do...end`
  when chaining.

    ```Ruby
    names = ['Bozhidar', 'Steve', 'Sarah']

    # bad
    names.each do |name|
      puts name
    end

    # good
    names.each { |name| puts name }

    # bad
    names.select do |name|
      name.start_with?('S')
    end.map { |name| name.upcase }

    # good
    names.select { |name| name.start_with?('S') }.map { |name| name.upcase }
    ```

    Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of {...}, but they should
    ask themselves - is this code really readable and can the blocks' contents be extracted into
    nifty methods?

* Avoid `return` where not required for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(some_arr)
      return some_arr.size
    end

    # good
    def some_method(some_arr)
      some_arr.size
    end
    ```

* Avoid `self` where not required. (It is only required when calling a self write accessor.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def ready?
      if self.last_reviewed_at > self.last_updated_at
        self.worker.update(self.content, self.options)
        self.status = :in_progress
      end
      self.status == :verified
    end

    # good
    def ready?
      if last_reviewed_at > last_updated_at
        worker.update(content, options)
        self.status = :in_progress
      end
      status == :verified
    end
    ```

* As a corollary, avoid shadowing methods with local variables unless they are both equivalent.

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      attr_accessor :options

      # ok
      def initialize(options)
        self.options = options
        # both options and self.options are equivalent here
      end

      # bad
      def do_something(options = {})
        unless options[:when] == :later
          output(self.options[:message])
        end
      end

      # good
      def do_something(params = {})
        unless params[:when] == :later
          output(options[:message])
        end
      end
    end
    ```

* Don't use the return value of `=` (an assignment) in conditional expressions.

    ```Ruby
    # bad (+ a warning)
    if (v = array.grep(/foo/))
      do_something(v)
      ...
    end

    # bad (+ a warning)
    if v = array.grep(/foo/)
      do_something(v)
      ...
    end

    # good
    v = array.grep(/foo/)
    if v
      do_something(v)
      ...
    end
    ```

* Use `||=` freely to initialize variables.

    ```Ruby
    # set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
    name ||= 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables. (Consider what
would happen if the current value happened to be `false`.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?
    ```

* Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    f (3 + 2) + 1

    # good
    f(3 + 2) + 1
    ```

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis,
  always use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write
`f((3 + 2) + 1)`.

* Use the new lambda literal syntax.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    lambda = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
    lambda.call(1, 2)

    # good
    lambda = ->(a, b) { a + b }
    lambda.(1, 2)
    ```

* Use `_` for unused block parameters.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = hash.map { |k, v| v + 1 }

    # good
    result = hash.map { |_, v| v + 1 }
    ```

* Use `$stdout/$stderr/$stdin` instead of
  `STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN`. `STDOUT/STDERR/STDIN` are constants, and
  while you can actually reassign (possibly to redirect some stream)
  constants in Ruby, you'll get an interpreter warning if you do so.

* Use ranges instead of complex comparison logic when possible.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    do_something if x >= 1000 && x < 2000

    # good
    do_something if (1000...2000).include?(x)
    ```

## Naming

* Name identifiers in English.
* Use `snake_case` for symbols, methods and variables.
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.

* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules.  (Keep acronyms like HTTP,
  RFC, XML uppercase.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Someclass
      ...
    end

    class Some_Class
      ...
    end

    class SomeXml
      ...
    end

    # good
    class SomeClass
      ...
    end

    class SomeXML
      ...
    end
    ```

* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`).

* The names of potentially *dangerous* methods (i.e. methods that
  modify `self` or the arguments, `exit!` (doesn't run the finalizers
  like `exit` does), etc.) should end with an exclamation mark if
  there exists a safe version of that *dangerous* method.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - there is not matching 'safe' method
    class Person
      def update!
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update!
      end

      def update
      end
    end
    ```

* Use `flat_map` instead of `map` + `flatten`.
  This does not apply for arrays with a depth greater than 2, i.e.
  if `users.first.songs == ['a', ['b','c']]`, then use `map + flatten` rather than `flat_map`.
  `flat_map` flattens the array by 1, whereas `flatten` flattens it all the way.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    all_songs = users.map(&:songs).flatten.uniq

    # good
    all_songs = users.flat_map(&:songs).uniq
    ```

## Comments

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!
* Write comments in English.
* Use one space between the leading `#` character of the comment and the text
  of the comment.
* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use [one
  space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.
* Avoid superfluous comments.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    counter += 1 # increments counter by one
    ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no comment
at all.

> Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation. <br/>
> -- Russ Olsen

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
  make it self-explanatory. (Do or do not - there is no try. --Yoda)

### Comment Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
  the relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
  lines should be indented two spaces after the `#`.

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      # FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v3.2.1. It may
      #   be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade.
      baz(:quux)
    end
    ```
* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
  added at a later date.
* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.

## Classes

* Try to make your classes as
  [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design\))
  as possible.
* When designing class hierarchies make sure that they conform to the
  [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
* Use a consistent structure in your class definitions.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      # extend and include go first
      extend SomeModule
      include AnotherModule

      # constants are next
      SOME_CONSTANT = 20

      # afterwards we have attribute macros
      attr_reader :name

      # followed by other macros (if any)
      validates :name

      # public class methods are next in line
      def self.some_method
      end

      # followed by public instance methods
      def some_method
      end

      # protected and private methods are grouped near the end
      protected

      def some_protected_method
      end

      private

      def some_private_method
      end
    end
    ```

* Always supply a proper `to_s` method for classes that represent
  domain objects.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      def to_s
        "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
      end
    end
    ```

* Consider adding factory methods to provide additional sensible ways
to create instances of a particular class.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      def self.create(options_hash)
        # body omitted
      end
    end
    ```

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior
in inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      @@class_var = 'parent'

      def self.print_class_var
        puts @@class_var
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      @@class_var = 'child'
    end

    Parent.print_class_var # => will print "child"
    ```

    As you can see all the classes in a class hierarchy actually share one
    class variable. Class instance variables should usually be preferred
    over class variables.

* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). 

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the code
  easier to refactor since the class name is not repeated.

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      def TestClass.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # good
      def self.some_other_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # Also possible and convenient when you
      # have to define many singleton methods.
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end
    end
    ```

## Methods

* Methods should not be longer than five lines of code.
  Empty lines do not contribute to the relevant LOC.
* Avoid parameter lists longer than four parameters.

## Exceptions

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    else
      n / d
    end
    ```

* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class.  This will trap signals and calls to
  `exit`, requiring you to `kill -9` the process.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # calls to exit and kill signals will be caught (except kill -9)
      exit
    rescue Exception
      puts "you didn't really want to exit, right?"
      # exception handling
    end

    # good
    begin
      # a blind rescue rescues from StandardError, not Exception as many
      # programmers assume.
    rescue => e
      # exception handling
    end

    # also good
    begin
      # an exception occurs here

    rescue StandardError => e
      # exception handling
    end

    ```

* Use *implicit begin blocks* where possible.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def foo
      begin
        # main logic goes here
      rescue
        # failure handling goes here
      end
    end

    # good
    def foo
      # main logic goes here
    rescue
      # failure handling goes here
    end
    ```

* Don't suppress exceptions.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue SomeError
      # the rescue clause does absolutely nothing
    end

    # bad
    do_something rescue nil
    ```

* Avoid using `rescue` in its modifier form.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - this catches all StandardError exceptions
    do_something rescue nil
    ```

* Favor the use of exceptions for the standard library over
introducing new exception classes.

## Collections

* Prefer literal array and hash creation notation (unless you need to
pass parameters to their constructors, that is).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    arr = Array.new
    hash = Hash.new

    # good
    arr = []
    hash = {}
    ```

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
words(non-empty strings without spaces and special characters in them).
Apply this rule only to arrays with two or more elements.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

    # good
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
    ```

* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with unique elements. `Set`
  implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This
  is a hybrid of `Array`'s intuitive inter-operation facilities and
  `Hash`'s fast lookup.
* Prefer symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Avoid the use of mutable objects as hash keys.
* Use the hash literal syntax when your hash keys are symbols.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2, :three => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
    ```

* Consider padding string interpolation code with space. It more clearly sets the
  code apart from the string.

    ```Ruby
    "#{ user.last_name }, #{ user.first_name }"
    ```

* Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or
  special symbols such as `\t`, `\n`, `'`, etc.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = "Bozhidar"

    # good
    name = 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
    ```

## Regular Expressions

* Avoid using $1-9 as it can be hard to track what they contain. Named groups
  can be used instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    /(regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process $1

    # good
    /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process meaningful_var
    ```

* Character classes have only a few special characters you should care about:
  `^`, `-`, `\`, `]`, so don't escape `.` or brackets in `[]`.

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string endings.
  If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\z` (not to be
  confused with `\Z` which is the equivalent of `/\n?\z/`).

    ```Ruby
    string = "some injection\nusername"
    string[/^username$/]   # matches
    string[/\Ausername\z/] # don't match
    ```

* Use `x` modifier for complex regexps. This makes them more readable and you
  can add some useful comments. Just be careful as spaces are ignored.

    ```Ruby
    regexp = %r{
      start         # some text
      \s            # white space char
      (group)       # first group
      (?:alt1|alt2) # some alternation
      end
    }x
    ```

## Percent Literals

* Use `%w` freely.

* Use `%()`(it's a shorthand for `%Q`) for single-line strings which require both interpolation
  and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs.

    ```Ruby
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)
    ```

* Use `%r` only for regular expressions matching *more than* one '/' character.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    %r(\s+)

    # still bad
    %r(^/(.*)$)
    # should be /^\/(.*)$/

    # good
    %r(^/blog/2011/(.*)$)
    ```

## Metaprogramming

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
  (Do not monkey-patch them.)

* The block form of `class_eval` is preferable to the string-interpolated form.
  - when you use the string-interpolated form, always supply `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`, so that your backtraces make sense:

    ```ruby
    class_eval 'def use_relative_model_naming?; true; end', __FILE__, __LINE__
    ```

  - `define_method` is preferable to `class_eval{ def ... }`

* When using `class_eval` (or other `eval`) with string interpolation, add a comment block showing its appearance if interpolated (a practice I learned from the Rails code):

    ```ruby
    # from activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/output_safety.rb
    UNSAFE_STRING_METHODS.each do |unsafe_method|
      if 'String'.respond_to?(unsafe_method)
        class_eval <<-EOT, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
          def #{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)       # def capitalize(*args, &block)
            to_str.#{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)  #   to_str.capitalize(*args, &block)
          end                                       # end

          def #{unsafe_method}!(*args)              # def capitalize!(*args)
            @dirty = true                           #   @dirty = true
            super                                   #   super
          end                                       # end
        EOT
      end
    end
    ```

* avoid using `method_missing` for metaprogramming. Backtraces become messy; the behavior is not listed in `#methods`; misspelled method calls might silently work (`nukes.launch_state = false`). Consider using delegation, proxy, or `define_method` instead.  If you must, use `method_missing`,
  - be sure to [also define `respond_to_missing?`](http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2010/11/methodmissing-politely.html)
  - only catch methods with a well-defined prefix, such as `find_by_*` -- make your code as assertive as possible.
  - call `super` at the end of your statement
  - delegate to assertive, non-magical methods:

    ```ruby
    # bad
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        # ... lots of code to do a find_by
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # good
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        find_by(prop, *args, &block)
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # best of all, though, would to define_method as each findable attribute is declared
    ```
